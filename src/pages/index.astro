                        Edge computing decentralizes an application to make websites faster by
                        having multiple computers around the world (the network of these being
                        called the "edge") running the same application, that way visitors to a site
                        can contact the nearest server instead of one from around the world.

                        While artificial intelligence is very powerful, it's a moral gray area.

                        used to impersonate and hurt others. Then there are the issues with how some
                        AI models learn, for example, many developers do not like how GitHub copilot
                        was trained with all public source code on GitHub and StackOverflow, because
                        there is no way to confirm whether it was <em>allowed</em> to use that code.
